# CIFAR-10 Image Classification API

This project provides a FastAPI-based API for classifying images using a pre-trained CIFAR-10 model. The API accepts an image file and returns the predicted class along with the confidence score.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify images into one of the 10 CIFAR-10 classes.
- **FastAPI**: Lightweight and fast API framework.
- **Docker Support**: Easy deployment using Docker.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses a pre-trained CNN model for CIFAR-10.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cifar10-image-classification.git](https://github.com/harsukh9/computer-vison.git
   cd cifar10-image-classification
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model:
   - The model file (`cifar10_cnn_model.h5`) is included in the `models/` directory.
   - If you want to retrain the model, run the `train_model.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Running the API Locally

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app:app --reload
   ```

2. The API will be available at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

3. Test the API using the `/predict` endpoint (see [Example Requests](#example-requests)).

## Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t cifar10-api .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 cifar10-api
   ```

3. The API will be available at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

## API Endpoints

### **GET /**
Returns a welcome message.

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to the CIFAR-10 Image Classification API!"
}
```

### **POST /predict**
Accepts an image file and returns the predicted class and confidence score.

**Request**:
- Method: `POST`
- URL: `/predict`
- Body: `form-data` with a key `file` and an image file (JPEG or PNG).

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "predicted_class": "dog",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

## Example Requests

### Using `curl`
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@test_image.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict
```

### Using Python `requests`
```python
import requests

url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict"
file_path = "test_image.jpg"

with open(file_path, "rb") as file:
    response = requests.post(url, files={"file": file})

print(response.json())
```

### Using Postman
1. Set the request type to `POST`.
2. Enter the URL:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict
   ```
3. Go to the **Body** tab, select `form-data`.
4. Add a key named `file` (ensure the type is `File`).
5. Upload an image file (JPEG or PNG).
6. Click **Send**.

## Deployed API

You can access the deployed API at:  
[https://7a43-34-136-34-95.ngrok-free.app]

(Replace this with the actual URL if you deploy the API on a cloud platform like Render, AWS, or GCP.)

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`).
5. Open a pull request.
